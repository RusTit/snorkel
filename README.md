<b>snorkel</b> is a real time data analysis  tool,  meant  to  answer  questions
about the *now*.  At its heart, snorkel is built on  the  idea  that  iterative
analysis is key to understanding.  In other words - when graphs move, it  should
be easy to drill down on what is happening and why, not a frustrating  exercise
in adjusting failed queries.

future plans
------------

**02/02/2019**: [Snorkel.lite](https://github.com/logv/snorkel/tree/slite) is a
re-write of snorkel's backend into python, maintaining compatibility with most
of snorkel. Try out the snorkel.lite branch to see how it works for you. It is
now in alpha status, but I've been using it for several months on my machines.

**11/28/2018**: After 5 years in the node ecosystem, I will be moving
snorkel to a python backend. Expect a new release in Q1 2019. I feel that the
node ecosystem has too much churn - it is difficult for me to make a package
that can be installed without problems or security issues and I would like
snorkel to have a lasting lifetime.

The new snorkel will have the same UI and retain many of the same features as
the current snorkel. Some advantages will be:

* adding new views will be easier for everyone
* code configured datasets
* less external dependencies
* package stability
